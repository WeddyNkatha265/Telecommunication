# WebRTC Video Chat Application

## Overview

This project is a simple WebRTC-based video chat application that allows users to have real-time video conversations directly from their browsers. It demonstrates the basic functionality of WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication along with signaling using Socket.IO and Node.js.

## Features

- Real-time video chat between two peers
- Local and remote video streams
- Signaling server using Socket.IO
- STUN server for NAT traversal

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webrtc-video-chat.git
   cd webrtc-video-chat
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install express socket.io
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```

4. Open the application in your browser:
   - Open two separate browser windows or tabs.
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in both windows.

## Usage

1. **Start Local Video**:
   - Click the "Start" button in both browser windows to start the local video streams.

2. **Initiate a Call**:
   - Click the "Call" button in one of the windows to start the video call.

3. **End the Call**:
   - Click the "Hang Up" button to end the call.

## Code Explanation

### HTML (`index.html`)

- Basic structure with video elements for local and remote streams.
- Buttons to control the call (Start, Call, Hang Up).

### CSS (`styles.css`)

- Styles for the video elements and buttons to ensure a clean UI.

### JavaScript (`webrtc.js`)

- Handles user media access, peer connection setup, and signaling.
- Uses Socket.IO to exchange signaling messages (offer, answer, and ICE candidates) between peers.

### Node.js Server (`server.js`)

- Serves static files and manages WebSocket connections using Socket.IO.
- Handles signaling messages for setting up the peer-to-peer connection.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure both browser windows are opened and navigated to `http://localhost:3000`.
- Check the browser console for any error messages.
- Verify that the Node.js server is running and no port conflicts exist.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for multiple participants.
- Implement text chat alongside video.
- Add screen sharing capabilities.
